# Rainfall Prediction Classifier

# **Objective**

The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts rainfall based on historical weather data. The key steps involved in this process include:

**1. Feature Engineering:** Exploring and transforming the real-world dataset to extract useful features.
**2. Classifier Pipeline:** Building and optimizing a machine learning pipeline using grid search cross-validation.
**3. Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using various metrics and visualizations.
**4. Model Optimization:** Implementing different classifiers and optimizing them for better predictions.
